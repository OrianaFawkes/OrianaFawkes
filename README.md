Hey there Nappers 👋 I’m Ori! Coffee makes me sleepy, but I enjoy it nonetheless. I’m usually asleep, otherwise I’m either learning something new or developing something new.

- 📜 I know my way around Java, Python, Dart, HTML, CSS, and JS
- 📚 I'm currently working my way around Flutter and Mobile Dev
- 🍰 Fun Fact: I can always be bribed with a slice of blueberry cheesecake or a cup of coffee

There are still a lot of things I'm figuring out, but that's what gives me motivation. Thanks for dropping by!
